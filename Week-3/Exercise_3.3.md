### Given Code

```JS

function createIncrement() {
    let count = 0;
    let message = `Count is ${count}`;
    function increment() {
        count++;
    }
    function log() {
        console.log(message);
    }
    return [increment, log];
}
const [increment, log] = createIncrement();
increment();
increment();
increment();
log();

```

### Output of the Given Program: Count is 0

### Explaination:

The createIncrement() method returns an array of two functions, increment and log, to generate a closure. The count and message variables are closure-specific and not accessible from the outside. The increment() function does nothing but increment the count variable, which is part of the closure. The log() method writes to the console the message variable, which is also part of the closure.

When the code is run, increment() is called three times, increasing the count variable to three. The log() function is then invoked, which prints the message "Count is 0" to the console. "Count is 0" is the message since it was assigned to the message variable when the closure was constructed, and the count variable was 0 at the time. By executing increment() three times, the count variable was increased three times, but the message variable still has the original value.
